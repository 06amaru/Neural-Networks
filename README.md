# Neural Network Experiments

🚧 **Project in Progress** 🚧
This repository is a personal learning journey into understanding how neural networks work.
The approach is **hands-on experimentation**, where I implement and test different models and ideas.

---

## 📌 Goals

* Build an intuitive understanding of neural networks.
* Compare coding styles and solutions from different AI assistants.
* Run experiments on real-world tasks where neural networks can be applied.

---

## 🔎 Project Structure

### **Part 1 – Agent Comparison**

A comparison between neural network implementations written with the help of 3 different AI agents:

* **Qwen3**
* **Claude Sonnet 4**
* **ChatGPT**

The goal is to analyze differences in:

* Code style
* Clarity
* Performance
* Learning value

---

### **Part 2 – Real-World Experiments**

Applying neural networks to practical problems.
The first experiment:

* **5-Star Review Classifier**

  * Input: review text + metadata
  * Output: exact star rating (1–5)

Future experiments will be added step by step.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on experiment)
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter notebooks for exploration

---

## 🚀 Work in Progress

This project is **exploratory**.
Expect code to be iterative, experimental, and sometimes messy.
The focus is **learning**, not production-ready ML pipelines.

---

## 📅 Roadmap

* [x] Set up repo
* [ ] Complete Part 1 – Agent comparison
* [x] Build baseline 5-star classifier
* [ ] Explore improvements with embeddings / advanced architectures
* [ ] Add more real-world experiments
